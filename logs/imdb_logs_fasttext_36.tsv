    "seq_a": "bela lugosi is a real enigma . in the early 1930s , he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula . yet , again and again , he made lousy decisions regarding his career . perhaps he had a bad agent , perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy . regardless , he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film -- ranging from excellent horror films ( such as the raven ) to big - budget flicks ( like ninotchka ) to grade - z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios . interestingly enough , although he agreed to do this terrible film , he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein ! as for this movie , it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing . lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs -- not a bad thing at all . but at the end , we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american - looking men he killed were actually japanese ! ! ! ! the funniest part of this is during a flashback . you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american - like men . when the camera scans them , the men are clearly asian . but , on all the other non - close - up shots , they are all very western looking -- many with bald heads ! ! they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men . i suspect the plot must have undergone a re - write and this might account for the obvious mistake . or , it could just be shoddy production values and editing . in fact , early in the film , they show a street scene in the city and all the cars ( circa 1942 ) are old model t fords -- obviously from stock footage ! ! ! the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull . unlike plan 9 from outer space , it 's hard to laugh at the ineptitude -- just be put to sleep by it .",

    "seq_a": "\" buffalo bill , hero of the far west \" director mario costa 's unsavory spaghetti western \" the beast \" with klaus kinski could only have been produced in europe . hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie . never mind that kinski is ideally suited to the role of ' crazy ' johnny . he plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit , pants , and hat . this low - budget oater has nothing appetizing about it . the typically breathtaking spanish scenery around almeria is nowhere in evidence . instead , costa and his director of photography luciano trasatti , who shot another kinski western \" and god said to cain , \" lensed this horse opera in rather mundane setting around tor caldara , lazio , italy and monte gelato falls , treja river , lazio , italy . nevertheless , \" the beast \" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with wholly unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that compel them to resort to criminal activities . predictably , their well - laid plans backfire owing largely to the kinski character . indeed , the licentious kinski character resembles a wily e. coyote type character . consistently , he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either lawmen or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts . ultimately , \" the beast \" amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony . the stelvio cipriani orchestral score sounds as if it were lifted by the tony anthony western \" the stranger returns . \" the mario costa screenplay takes place on the western frontier between san diego and mexico that is being terrorized by a notorious mexican bandit called machete ( giovanni pallavicino of \" we still kill the old way \" ) and his gang . they prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their depredations . the first time that we see ' crazy ' johnny laster he pauses to refresh himself at a stream and spots a gorgeous looking woman washing clothes . he creeps up behind her and attacks her , but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee . he shows up in a nearby town and a snuff - snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man , mr. powers , on the trail and rob him . they wind up killing him and getting no money . mr. snuff - sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder .

    "adv": "\" buffalo bill , hero of the far west \" director mario costa 's unsavory spaghetti western \" the beast \" with klaus kinski could only have been produced in europe . hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie . never mind that kinski is ideally suited to the role of ' crazy ' johnny . he plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit , pants , and hat . this low - budget oater has nothing appetizing about it . the typically breathtaking spanish scenery around almeria is nowhere in evidence . instead , costa and his director of photography luciano trasatti , who shot another kinski western \" and god said to cain , \" lensed this horse opera in rather mundane setting around tor caldara , lazio , italy and monte gelato falls , treja river , lazio , italy . nevertheless , \" the beast \" qualifies as a continental western because it deals with wholly unscrupulous characters and the action could be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by intolerable circumstances that compel them to resort to criminal activities . predictably , their well - laid plans backfire owing largely to the kinski character . indeed , the licentious kinski character resembles a wily e. coyote type character . consistently , he struggles to have sex with several beautiful women but either lawmen or outlaws frustrate each of his efforts . ultimately , \" the beast \" amounts to a tragic character study brimming with irony . the stelvio cipriani orchestral score sounds as if it were lifted by the tony anthony western \" the stranger returns . \" the mario costa screenplay takes place on the western frontier between san diego and mexico that is being terrorized by a notorious mexican bandit called machete ( giovanni pallavicino of \" we still kill the old way \" ) and his gang . they prey on the stagecoach and nobody is safe from their depredations . the first time that we see ' crazy ' johnny laster he pauses to refresh himself at a stream and spots a gorgeous looking woman washing clothes . he creeps up behind her and attacks her , but a bigger man armed with a rifle intervenes and he has to flee . he shows up in a nearby town and a snuff - snorting gunslinger recruits him to help ambush a wealthy man , mr. powers , on the trail and rob him . they wind up killing him and getting no money . mr. snuff - sniffer accidentally leaves his snuff box at the scene of the crime and the sheriff arrests on suspicion of murder .
